# Antidepressant-Methylation

This repository contains R scripts for analyzing DNA methylation data (Illumina EPIC) in relation to antidepressant treatment response.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Identify common probes between EPIC1 and EPIC2 arrays.
- Align methylation data with patient treatment information.
- Calculate treatment response slopes over time.
- Filter patients by drug type and medication criteria.
- Prepare methylation and response datasets for downstream statistical analysis.
